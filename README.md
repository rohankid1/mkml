# mkml
mkdl is a simple, cross-platform? command written in Rust to initialize a simple
HTML website project with organisation.

This project is in very early stages of developments and some stuff
are not complete; for example, selecting a log level flag will not do anything yet. Also, there is yet to be a installation guide so they will both be coming soon.
